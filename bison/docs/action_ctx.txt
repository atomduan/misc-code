--------------
$$                              [Variable]
Acts like a variable that contains the semantic value for the grouping made by 
the current rule. See Section 3.4.6 [Actions], page 60.

--------------
$n                              [Variable] 
Acts like a variable that contains the semantic value for the nth component of 
the current rule. See Section 3.4.6 [Actions], page 60.

--------------
$<typealt>$                     [Variable] 
Like $$ but specifies alternative typealt in the union 
specified by the %union decla- ration. See Section 3.4.7 [Data Types of Values 
in Actions], page 61.

--------------
$<typealt>n                     [Variable] 
Like $n but specifies alternative typealt in the union 
specified by the %union decla- ration. See Section 3.4.7 [Data Types of Values 
in Actions], page 61.

--------------
YYABORT ;                       [Macro] 
Return immediately from yyparse, indicating failure. See 
Section 4.1 [The Parser Function yyparse], page 96.

--------------
YYACCEPT ;                      [Macro] 
Return immediately from yyparse, indicating success. See 
Section 4.1 [The Parser Function yyparse], page 96.

--------------
YYBACKUP (token, value);        [Macro] 
Unshift a token. This macro is allowed only 
for rules that reduce a single value, and only when there is no lookahead 
token. It is also disallowed in GLR parsers. It installs a lookahead token with 
token type token and semantic value value; then it discards the value that was 
going to be reduced by this rule.  If the macro is used when it is not valid, 
such as when there is a lookahead token already, then it reports a syntax error 
with a message ‘cannot back up’ and performs ordinary error recovery.  In 
either case, the rest of the action is not executed.

--------------
YYEMPTY                         [Macro]
Value stored in yychar when there is no lookahead token.

--------------
YYEOF                           [Macro]
Value stored in yychar when the lookahead is the end of the input stream.

--------------
YYERROR                         [Macro]
Cause an immediate syntax error. This statement initiates error recovery just 
as if the parser itself had detected an error; however, it does not call 
yyerror, and does not print any message. If you want to print an error message, 
call yyerror explicitly before the ‘YYERROR;’ statement. See Chapter 6 [Error 
Recovery], page 125.

--------------
YYRECOVERING                    [Macro] 
The expression YYRECOVERING () yields 1 when the parser is 
recovering from a syntax error, and 0 otherwise. See Chapter 6 [Error 
Recovery], page 125.

--------------
yychar                          [Variable] 
Variable containing either the lookahead token, or YYEOF when 
the lookahead is the end of the input stream, or YYEMPTY when no lookahead has 
been performed so the next token is not yet known. Do not modify yychar in a 
deferred semantic action (see Section 1.5.3 [GLR Semantic Actions], page 22). 
See Section 5.1 [Lookahead Tokens], page 106.

--------------
yyclearin ;                     [Macro] 
Discard the current lookahead token. This is useful 
primarily in error rules. Do not invoke yyclearin in a deferred semantic action 
(see Section 1.5.3 [GLR Semantic Actions], page 22). See Chapter 6 [Error 
Recovery], page 125.

--------------
yyerrok ;                       [Macro] 
Resume generating error messages immediately for subsequent 
syntax errors. This is useful primarily in error rules. See Chapter 6 [Error 
Recovery], page 125.

--------------
yylloc                          [Variable] 
Variable containing the lookahead token location when yychar 
is not set to YYEMPTY or YYEOF. Do not modify yylloc in a deferred semantic 
action (see Section 1.5.3 [GLR Semantic Actions], page 22). See Section 3.5.2 
[Actions and Locations], page 67.

--------------
yylval                          [Variable] 
Variable containing the lookahead token semantic value when 
yychar is not set to YYEMPTY or YYEOF. Do not modify yylval in a deferred 
semantic action (see Section 1.5.3 [GLR Semantic Actions], page 22). See 
Section 3.4.6 [Actions], page 60.

--------------
@$                              [Value] 
Acts like a structure variable containing information on the textual 
location of the grouping made by the current rule. See Section 3.5 [Tracking 
Locations], page 67.

--------------
@n                              [Value] 
Acts like a structure variable containing information on the textual 
location of the nth component of the current rule. See Section 3.5 [Tracking 
Locations], page 67.
