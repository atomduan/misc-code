/**
 * The lexical analyzerâ€™s job is low-level parsing: converting characters or sequences of char- acters into tokens.
 * This works in two ways. 
 * If the token type is a character literal, 
 * then its numeric code is that of the character; 
 * you can use the same character literal in the lexical analyzer to express the number. 
 * If the token type is an identifier, 
 * that identifier is defined by Bison as a C macro 
 * whose definition is the appropriate number. 
 * In this example, therefore, NUM becomes a macro for yylex to use.
